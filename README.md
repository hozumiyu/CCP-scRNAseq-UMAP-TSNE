# CCP-scRNAseq-UMAP-TSNE

## Overview

Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) is a data-domain dimensionality reduction algorithm. In this repository, you will find the code used to reproduce "Analyzing scRNA-seq data by CCP-assisted UMAP and t-SNE", which is under revision.

CCP performs dimensionality reduction in 2 steps. 
1) Correlated Clustering: The data's features (ie genes) is partitioned according to their similarity. In this paper, we utilized k-means clustering, but any partitioning scheme can be utilized
2) Projection: Using the gene clusters, the samples are projected using Flexibility Ridigity Index to obtain a single descriptor. This is essentially the weighted sum over the accumulation of the gene-gene correlation over the cells.

## Dependency
1) Python==3.8.2
2) pandas==1.30
2) numpy==1.20.3
3) umap-lean==0.5.1
4) scikit-learn==0.24.2
5) matplotlib==3.4.2
6) wget==3.2
wget will be required for preprocessing the data. 

Please run the following in your new virtual environment.
` pip install -r requirement.txt `

## Running the code
There should not be any need to do modification to the code as long as your directory is set to the location of main.py

To run the code, use the following:
`python main.py dataset_name `

Currently, you can run GSE57249, GSE67835, GSE75748time, GSE75748cell, GSE82187, GSE84133human4, GSE84133mouse1, GSE94820
